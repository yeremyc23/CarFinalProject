In this project I want to make a text adventure that will allow you to customize a car of your choice. Each car will have its own horsepower rating, of course as you choose more modifications for that car the horsepower will increase. At the end you will have an output with your cars stats. At the end of the adventure once your car is created there will be an option for a scoreboard so you can see how your car stats compares to others. This will give you an Idea of how you are ranked against others.

In the future I would do my planning much better and also think ahead about the ending of the code especially when it comes to a text adventure because that would have saved me from much trouble and alsos restarting my code. The best part was getting the project to work completely, to the point where it was presentable.I am honestly proud of how far the project has come within the amount of time that I worked on it.
