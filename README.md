Draft 1:

My idea for my project is to create a car creator adventure where you can choose many different vehicleâ€™s from American, German, Japanese and Italian. Each of these manufacturers is going to have their own class of cars. Within those classes you will have a some options of some vehicles to pick. 

	This adventure will allow you to create a car of your choice with different options of upgrades. You will also be able to choose certain car such as turbo, suspension. All of these will affect your cars stats, once you are finished picking all of your parts you will be ranked on how fast your car is.   

Draft 2:

	In this project I want to make a text adventure  that will allow you to customize a car of your choice. Each car will have its own horsepower rating, of course as you choose more modifications for that car the horsepower will increase. At the end you will have an output with your cars stats.

	At the end of the adventure once your car is created there will be an option for a scoreboard so you can see how your car stats compares to others. This will give you an Idea of how you are ranked against others.

Goal 1: Figure out the classes for the manufacturers of cars. Have all the cars that will be in the adventure and the type of modifications

Goal 2: Figure out how these modifications will affect the cars stats.

Stretch goals: Have divisions and stats compare against each other for a ranking system

Super stretch goals:  Have you compete against a random car in a drag race.

Milestones
Milestone 1: Before march 31st I want to have my code running, be able to fix all my bugs and issues.
Milestone 2: I want to make sure there is no bugs with my code, making sure everything works smoothly.
