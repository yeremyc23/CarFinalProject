In this project I want to make a text adventure that will allow you to customize a car of your choice. Each car will have its own horsepower rating, of course as you choose more modifications for that car the horsepower will increase. At the end you will have an output with your cars stats. At the end of the adventure once your car is created there will be an option for a scoreboard so you can see how your car stats compares to others. This will give you an Idea of how you are ranked against others.

1. Upgrade stats of any car
2. Downgrade stats of any car
3. View stats of all the cars

You have 300 Dollars to spend on upgrades.
